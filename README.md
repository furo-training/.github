# Template repository

This repository can be used to store workflow templates. As long as this repository is **Public**, the workflow templates will show up in the Starter workflow overview :tada:

## Usage

### Use this workflow template

1. Create a new repository within the same organization
1. Navigate to the starter workflow overview
1. Observe the custom workflow showing up

:bulb: If the workflow template doesn't show up, it's most likely because the `.github` repository visibility is not **Public**.
