## Welcome to the demo org for GitHub Actions Fundamentals üëã

In this organization you will find multiple repositories used to demo the functionalities in scope for the training.

Each demo repo is prefixed with `demo-`, and will contain a `README.md` describing how to walk through it. üçø

:bulb: Some of the demo repositories are configured as templates, so that you can use them in a different organization if needed. 
Make sure that you have reviewed the demo `README.md` first, so that you're sure the demo will function properly in the new organization (for example repository secrets etc.).

:bow: Thank you following the **Cleanup** steps after each demo.
